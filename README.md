# Student-Records-Database-Project
# Student Record Management System

This project, developed as part of Computer Science II (CS2), is a command-line based application written in C++. The program allows users to manage student records, including their names, GPAs, and credits. The system employs object-oriented programming principles, arrays, and various other C++ features to achieve its functionality.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need a compiler that can compile C++ code. This project was developed using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), but should work with any standard C++ compiler.

# Prerequisites
C++ Compiler (GCC recommended)
Terminal/command-line interface
# Installing

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone <repository-url>.
Navigate to the project directory.
Compile the project using your C++ compiler. 
  
# Running the Program

Once compiled, you can run the program using the command ./outputfile (replace outputfile with the name you chose during compilation).

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter student information including the student's name, GPA, and credits.
